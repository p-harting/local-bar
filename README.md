## UX
Wireframes were meticulously crafted using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), leveraging its versatile design capabilities and collaborative features.

The color palette was thoughtfully created using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/), ensuring that the chosen colors resonate with the brand identity and evoke the desired ambiance for the Local Bar website.
### Wireframes
Wireframes play a crucial role in the development process, providing a visual guide for the layout and structure of each webpage. They serve as blueprints, outlining the placement of key elements such as navigation bars, content sections, and footer areas.

For the Local Bar website, wireframes were meticulously crafted to ensure an intuitive and user-friendly interface across all devices. Each wireframe represents a unique page, from the captivating landing page to the informative events and drinks pages.

### Color Palette
![Accessible color palette](assets/docs/ux/colour-palette.png)
For the Local Bar website, a carefully curated color palette has been selected to evoke the ambiance and energy of a neighborhood bar.

- Dark Brown: #402E32
The rich, deep hue of dark brown serves as the main accent color, symbolizing the warmth and inviting atmosphere typical of a local bar. This color choice exudes sophistication and hints at the rich tones found in aged spirits, creating a sense of tradition and authenticity.

- Warm White: #FFF8F1
The background color, warm white, envelops the website with a welcoming glow, reminiscent of soft lighting in a dimly lit bar. This choice creates a comfortable backdrop for content, ensuring readability and allowing other elements to stand out.

- Light Gray: #D3D3D3
Light gray adds a subtle touch of elegance and professionalism to text elements throughout the website. It complements the dark brown accent color while providing contrast against the warm white background, enhancing readability and visual hierarchy.

- Mid Gray: #6D6D6D
Mid-gray is utilized for shadows and subtle design elements, adding depth and dimension to the website's layout. Its neutral tone ensures that shadows blend seamlessly with the overall color scheme, enhancing visual appeal without overpowering other elements.

- Dark Gray: #3A3A3A
As the darkest shade in the palette, dark gray is employed sparingly for text and UI elements where emphasis and contrast are needed. Its deep tone adds a touch of sophistication and sharpness to key components, guiding users' attention and improving usability.

In essence, this color palette reflects the ambiance of a local bar, where patrons can unwind and socialize in a comfortable and inviting environment.

### Fonts
For this project, I've incorporated Playfair Display and Lato fonts sourced from Google Fonts. The font sizes are dynamically adjusted for responsive design.
- Playfair Display is employed for the page logo and headings.
- Lato is utilized for the menu and body text.
